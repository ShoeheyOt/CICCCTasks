# Algorithm Assignment <br>Leet Code no.1 "Two Sum"

## This article is for school task

The detail of the task is below.

  **Write 1 blog/article about algorithms in any manner, not limited to JavaScript. You can write about objectives or how algorithms solve problems. You can provide information, offer suggestions and advice to a reader who may not know what an algorithm is.
  Writing a script to give examples is also valued and recommended. You may write an article that revolves around the topic of JavaScript.**

I don't have any working experience as a developer, have just started learning programming, so with meaning of review and deepen understanding of basic of algorithm, I tried to explain how to solve Leet code no.1 "Two Sum".

First of all, below is the explanation of two sum problem.

**Leet Code Two Sum explanation**  

 ```markdown
 Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
 You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

 Example1
 Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1]

Example2
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example3
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

Constraints:

$2 <= nums.length <= 10^4$
$-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9$
$-10^9 <= target <= 10^9$
Only one valid answer exists.

```

$2 <= nums.length <= 10^4$  
$-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9$  
$-10^9 <= target <= 10^9$
